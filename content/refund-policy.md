# Refund Policy

Last updated: [Date]

At [Your SaaS Name], we strive to ensure your satisfaction with our service. This refund policy outlines the terms and conditions for refunds on our subscription-based software service.

## Eligibility for Refunds

1. **14-Day Money-Back Guarantee**: We offer a 7-day money-back guarantee for new subscribers. If you are not satisfied with our service, you can request a full refund within 7 days of your initial subscription purchase.

2. **Subscription Cancellations**: For ongoing subscriptions, we do not provide partial refunds for unused time if you cancel your subscription mid-billing cycle. Your service will continue until the end of the current billing period.

3. **Annual Subscriptions**: For annual subscriptions, refunds may be considered on a pro-rata basis for the unused portion of the service, less any applicable fees, and at the discretion of our management.

## Non-Refundable Items

1. **Setup Fees**: Any one-time setup or onboarding fees are non-refundable.

2. **Add-on Services**: Additional services or features purchased separately from the main subscription are generally non-refundable unless otherwise stated at the time of purchase.

## How to Request a Refund

1. To request a refund, please contact our customer support team at [support@yourcompany.com] or through our support portal.

2. Please provide your account information and the reason for your refund request.

3. Refund requests will be processed within 5-10 business days after approval.

## Refund Method

Refunds will be issued using the original method of payment used for the purchase. If this is not possible, we will work with you to find an alternative refund method.

## Exceptions

1. We reserve the right to deny refund requests that we suspect are an abuse of our refund policy or for accounts that have violated our Terms of Service.

2. In cases of service outages or technical issues on our end that significantly impact your ability to use the service, we may offer credits or partial refunds at our discretion.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this refund policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
